# Tennis Tracker

Tennis Tracker is a small React application for tracking your training sessions and managing related information. It runs entirely in the browser and stores its data using `localStorage` so there is no backend to set up.

## Installation

Install dependencies with npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Then start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch Vite's dev server and you can visit the app at the URL printed in the console.

## Core Features

- **Dashboard** – quick overview of recent trainings and tasks with charts.
- **Todos** – create and organize practice tasks using drag‑and‑drop.
- **Players** – store details about sparring partners or opponents.
- **Training** – log sessions with duration, intensity and notes.
- **Statistics** – visualise progress with bar, line and pie charts.

All information is persisted locally in your browser's `localStorage` so data is kept between sessions.
